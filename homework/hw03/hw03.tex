\begin{itemize}
  \item
Find $\Theta(T(n))$ for each case.
\item
For problem 1, find the solution three ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item The master theorem
\item The substitution method
\item Iterate, cancel, and solve the summation
  to find an exact solution.
\end{itemize}
\item
For all other problems, use just the master theorem.
\item
When using the master theorem, be explicit about $n^{\log_b a}$,
and about which case of the master theorem applies,
about making sure the special condition applies in case 3
of the master theorem, and
about proving $f$'s correct
asymptotic relationship to $n^{\log_b a}$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item

  Solve this one three different ways:  master theorem,
  substitution method, and the iterate/cancel/summation method.

  \[T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n^4\]


\item Solve this one using the master theorem.
  \[T(n) = 16T(n/4) + n^2\]

  
\item Solve this one using the master theorem.
  \[T(n) = 2T(n/4) + \sqrt{n}\]

\item Solve this one using the master theorem.
  \[T(n) = 4T(n/3) + n\lg n\]

\item Solve this one using the master theorem.
  \[T(n) = 4T(n/2) + n^2\sqrt{n}\]

\end{enumerate}
