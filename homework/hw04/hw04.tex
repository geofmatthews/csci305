Explain the reasoning behind each answer.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Suppose we shuffle a deck of 10 cards, each bearing a distinct
  number from 1 to 10, to mix the cards thoroughly.  We then remove
  three cards, one at a time, from the deck.  What is the probability
  that we select the three cards in sorted (increasing) order?

\item
  Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem,
  known as the {\bf hat-check problem}.
  Each of $n$ customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a
  restaurant.  The hat-check person gives the hats back to the customers
  in a random order.  What is the expected number of customers who get
  back their own hat?

\end{enumerate}
