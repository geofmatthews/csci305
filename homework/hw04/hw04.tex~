\item
  Suppose we shuffle a deck of 10 cards, each bearing a distinct
  number from 1 to 10, to mix the cards thoroughly.  We then remove
  three cards, one at a time, from the deck.  What is the probability
  that we select the three cards in sorted (increasing) order?

  {\bf Solution 1:}

  The first card, $i$, must be $1, ..., 8$, each with probability
  $1/10$.
  After we choose the first card, $i$, 
  the second card, $j$, must be among the $9-i$ cards greater than $i$
  and less than 10.  Each of these choices has probability $1/9$,
  since there are only 9 total cards left.
  After we choose the second card, $j$,
 the third card, $k$, must be among the $10-j$ cards greater than $j$,
 and each has probability
  $1/8$, since there are now 8 cards left.  Thus our probability is
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{8} \frac{1}{10} \left(
    \sum_{j=i+1}^{9} \frac{1}{9} \left(
    \sum_{k=j+1}^{10} \frac{1}{8} \right)\right)
    &=
    \frac{1}{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8} \sum_{i=1}^{8} \left(
      \sum_{j=i+1}^{9} \left(
      \sum_{k=j+1}^{10} 1 \right)\right)\\
    &=
    \frac{1}{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8} \sum_{i=1}^{8} \left(
      \sum_{j=i+1}^{9} \left(
      10-j      \right)\right)\\
    &=
    \frac{1}{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8} \sum_{i=1}^{8} \left(
    \sum_{j=1}^{9-i} j
    \right)\\
    &=
    \frac{1}{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8} \sum_{i=1}^{8} \left(
\frac{(9-i)(9-i+1)}{2}
    \right)\\
    &=
    \frac{1}{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8\cdot 2} \sum_{i=1}^{8} \left(
    {i^2  - 19i    + 10\cdot 9 }
    \right)\\
    &=
    \frac{1}{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8\cdot 2}\left(
    { \sum_{i=1}^{8} i^2  -  \sum_{i=1}^{8} 19i    +  \sum_{i=1}^{8} 10\cdot 9 }
    \right)\\
    &=
    \frac{1}{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8\cdot 2}\left(
          \frac{8\cdot 9\cdot 17}{6}
           -
           \frac{19\cdot 8\cdot 9}{2}
           + 
           10\cdot 9\cdot 8
    \right)\\
    &= 1/6
  \end{align*}

  {\bf Solution 2:}  Rephrase the problem.  First pick three cards
  at random, and then arrange them in a random order.  No matter which
  three cards we pick, only one out of the $3!$ possible random orders 
 will be sorted, so the probability is $1/6$.

\item
  Use indicator random variables to solve the following problem,
  known as the {\bf hat-check problem}.
  Each of $n$ customers gives a hat to a hat-check person at a
  restaurant.  The hat-check person gives the hats back to the customers
  in a random order.  What is the expected number of customers who get
  back their own hat?

  {\bf Solution:}
  Let $X_i$ be the indicator random variable that is 1 when person $i$
  gets the right hat.  The probability that person $i$ gets the right
  hat is $1/n$.  Let $X=\sum_i X_i$.
  The expected number of people who get the right hat
  back is then
  \begin{align*}
    E[X] &= E\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\right] \\
    &=    \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] \\
    &=    \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1/n \\
&= 1
  \end{align*}
  
\item Suppose we toss balls into $b$ bins
  until some bin contains two balls.  Each toss
  is independent, and each ball is equally likely to end up in any bin.
  What is the expected number of ball tosses?

  {\bf Solution:}

  This is the same setup as the birthday problem, we are just asking a
  different question.  What is the average number of people you check before
  you find a duplicated birthday?
  
  In this solution I use $n$ for the number of bins because it seems
  more general.

The probability that the first $i$ tosses land in different bins
is (see text)
\begin{align*}
  P(X=i) &= \left(\frac{n}{n}\right)
  \left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)
  \left(\frac{n-2}{n}\right)
  \cdots
  \left(\frac{n-i+1}{n}\right)\\
&=  \frac{n!}{(n-i)!n^i}\\
  &= \frac{n^{\underline{i}}}{n^i}
\end{align*}
where $n^{\underline{i}}$ denotes
the falling factorial power\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_and_rising_factorials}}.


Let $X_i$ be the indicator variable for $i$ tosses, and $X=\sum_i X_i$.
Then
\begin{align*}
E[X] &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]\\
&=  \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{n^{\underline{i}}}{n^i}
\end{align*}
This is the expected number of tosses all into different bins.
The first toss to duplicate a bin is one more than this, so the answer
is
\begin{align*}
  1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{n!}{(n-i)!n^i}
  &=
  1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{n^{\underline{i}}}{n^i}
\end{align*}
This answer is also the one derived by
Knuth\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem}},
and apparently does not simplify.
