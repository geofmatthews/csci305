\begin{enumerate}
\item Analysis of d-ary heaps (problem 6-2 in the text).

 A \textbf{d-ary heap} is like a binary heap, but (with one possible
 exception) non-leaf nodes have $d$ children instead of 2 children.
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item How would you represent a $d$-ary heap in an array?
   \item What is the height of a $d$-ary heap of $n$ elements in terms
     of $n$ and $d$?
   \item Give an efficient implementation of \textsc{Extract-Max} in
       a $d$-ary max-heap.  Analyze its running time in terms of $d$
       and $n$.
     \item Give an efficient implementation of \textsc{Insert} in
       a $d$-ary max-heap.  Analyze its running time in terms of $d$
       and $n$.
     \item Give an efficient implementation of
       \textsc{Increase-Key}$(A,i,k)$,
       which flags an error if $k < A[i]$, but otherwise sets $A[i] =
       k$ and then updates the $d$-ary max-heap structure
       appropriately.    Analyze its running time in terms of $d$
       and $n$.
