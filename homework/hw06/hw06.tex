\begin{enumerate}
\item Alternative quicksort analysis (problem 7-3 in the text).

  An alternative analysis of the running time of randomized quicksort
  focuses on the expected running time of each individial recursive
  call to {\sc Randomized-Quicksort}, rather than on the number of
  comparisons performed.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Argue that, given an array of size $n$, the probability that
      any particular element is chosen as the pivot is $1/n$.  Use
      this to define indicator random variables
      \[
      X_i = I\{\mbox{$i$th smallest element is chosen as the pivot}\}
      \]
      What is $E[X_i]$?

    \item
      Let $T(n)$ be a random variable denoting the running time of
      quicksort on an array of size $n$.  Argue that
      \begin{align}
      E[T(n)] &= E\left[
        \sum_{q=1}^n X_q(T(q-1) + T(n-q) + \Theta(n))
        \right]
      \label{eqn1}
      \end{align}

    \item
      Show that we can rewrite equation \ref{eqn1} as
      \begin{align}
        E[T(n)] &= \frac{2}{n}\sum_{q=2}^{n-1}E[T(q)] + \Theta(n)
          \label{eqn2}
      \end{align}

    \item
      Show that
      \begin{align}
        \sum_{k=2}^{n-1} k \lg k \leq \frac{1}{2}n^2\lg n -
        \frac{1}{8} n^2
        \label{eqn3}
      \end{align}
      (Hint: Split the summation into two parts, one for
      $k=2,3,...,\lceil n/2 \rceil - 1$
      and one for
      $k= \lceil n/2\rceil,...,n-1$

    \item
      Using the bound from equation \ref{eqn3}, show that the
      recurrence in equation \ref{eqn2} has the solution
      $E[T(n)] = \Theta(n\lg n)$.  (Hint: Show, by substitution, that
      $E[T(n)\leq an\lg n$ for sufficiently large $n$ and for some
        positive constant $a$.)
