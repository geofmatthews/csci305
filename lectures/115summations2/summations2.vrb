\frametitle{Final Notes} 
In practice, almost any sum you come across will be of the form:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n f(i)
\]
where either:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    $f(n)$ is exponential.

    Then it's bounded by a geometric series and
the largest term dominates.
\item
  $f(n)$ is polynomial.

  Then $f(n/2) =\Theta(f(n))$ and the sum is
$\Theta(nf(n))$ using the lower bound:
\[
\sum_{i=n/2}^n f(n) =\Omega(nf(n))
\]
\end{itemize}
