\frametitle{The birthday paradox} 
\bi
\item
How many people must be in a room before there is a 50\% chance of two
of them having the same birthday? Assumptions:
\item
 \[\pr{b_i = r} = 1/n\mbox{ for }i=1..k\mbox{ and }r=1..n\]
\item
  \begin{align*}
    \pr{b_i=r \mbox{ and } b_j=r} &=
    \pr{b_i=r}\pr{b_j=r}\\ &= 1/n^2
    \end{align*}
\item Hence
