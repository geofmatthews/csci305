\frametitle{How does radix sort violate the $\Omega (n\lg n)$ speed limit?} 
\bi
\ii Counting sort allows us to gain information
about keys other than by directly comparing two keys.
\ii Directly comparing keys only gives one bit of information.
\ii Using keys as array indices
gets far more information out
of each key.
\ii Branching factor of the decision tree is $k$.
\ii Choosing one of $k$ branches gets $\lceil \lg k\rceil$
bits of information.
