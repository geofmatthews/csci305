\frametitle{How does radix sort violate the $\Omega (n\lg n)$ speed limit?} 
\bi
\ii Counting sort allows us to gain information
about keys\bi\ii other than by directly comparing 2 keys.\ei
\ii Used keys as array indices,
\bi\ii thus getting far more information out
of each key.
\ii branching factor of the decision tree is $k$
