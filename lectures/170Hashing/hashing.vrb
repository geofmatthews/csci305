\frametitle{Analysis of open address hashing, successful search} 

{\bf Theorem 11.8}

Assuming uniform hashing and every key is equally likely,
in an open-address hash table with load factor $\alpha < 1$
the expected number of probes in a successful search is at most
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha}\ln\frac{1}{1-\alpha}
\]

\bi
\ii If $\alpha = 0.5$, then we expect less than 1.387 probes on
average.
\ii If $\alpha = 0.9$, then we expect less than 2.559 probes on
average.
